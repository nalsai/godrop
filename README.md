I was annoyed by the lack of a simple service that I could run on my own server, to let other people upload files to me. So I made one in one day.

Nextcloud file drop is great but I somewhat dislike Nextcloud and wanted something simpler.

## TODO

### server

- add environment variables for configuration

### ui

- handle (ignore?) dropped folders
- indicate not being able to drop new files while uploading

### other

- add a license
- add a readme
- add a dockerfile and build action
-
